My Final Project Fitness tracker application

I am Shivani Prajapati(N03639282). I created fitness application using angular. This application includes node js, html,css, typescript etc files.The main functionality of this application is user is able to login into it.When user manually input the value in any of activity , it is stored into database(back end). I used Mongoodb database for storing the value in the database.

Attached screenshot of fitness application.
