# 2018-Spring
# Final Project Fitness tracker application

I am Shivani Prajapati(N03639282). I created fitness application using angular. This application includes homepage,register,login,dashboard page.The main functionality of this application is user is able to login into it.When user manually input the value in any of activity , it is stored into database(back end). I used Mongoodb database for storing the value in the database.

First it start with Home page. User can see the two option:Register and login.New user can start with Register.After that automatically user will be redirected in login page. All validation is applied for login and Registration.After completing login user will be redirected in dashboard page. Here user can see four activity: Walking, Running, Cycling, Sleeping. One input box is displayed above the progress bar of activity. On that, user can input the value then the value will be stored. User can track see all records.I implement login using MongoDB.
